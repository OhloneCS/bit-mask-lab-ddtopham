\normalpage{Bit Mask Lab}{
This lab explores an application of using bit masks to place
a graphic image transparently on another image.

First we will create a background.ppm image (in C and then in asm).
Second we will create a bitmask of the tree.ppm image. 

The tree.ppm image is surrounded and interspersed
with white pixels, and we want to 
``remove'' those from background.ppm image it is being overlayed onto so that any 
colors of the background will be visible instead of those white pixels.

Since white is represented as rgb of 0xff 0xff 0xff, then we can
create a bit mask by removing all colors except 0xff's. We will be left 
with a black \& white image where the original colors will be  
black. Then using this mask we can use the AND instruction to remove
those pixels from the background. (Later, in part 2 of lab we will OR
the original image into that modified background)
